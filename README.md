# MappingFamilyHistories
Spatial-Temporal narratives using Historical GIS to map individual Oral Histories

## Overview
The goal of this project is to draw data from a wide variety of sources to enhance our understanding of oral history narratives within a map-based historical timeline. The initial goal is to create a base map/timeline of European border changes between 1880-1980 utilizing open source GIS data.  The base map will draw from various existing open datasets and will be available via geoJSON for others to use with Leaflet.js, Mapbox, CartoDB and other web-based mapping applications.
  Once the basemap is complete, various media layers will be added according to each specific individual narrative. For example, a family member's rememberances as a refugee in WW2 Europe will include markers highlighting significant events, historical aerial bombing surveys, georeferenced historic maps, diagrams highlighting military movements, photos, videos, audio etc...
  
## Basemap
  Data will be extracted from the following Datasets with each adhering to a specific timespan-
  
  * 1880-1938- [http://worldmap.harvard.edu/maps/886](Mapping Imperial Russia) (Russia Only)
  * 1938-1945- [https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/pub.php?id=51](Stamford Spatial History Project-Building the New Order: 1938-1945)
  * 1945-Present- [http://nils.weidmann.ws/projects/cshapes.html](CSHAPES Cold War Dataset)
